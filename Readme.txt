WeatherAnalyzer
Huco 617 (Advanced Web Scripting)
Winter Term 2014
University of Alberta

"Everybody complains about the weather," goes the saying, "but no one does anything about it." This little project is an attempt to find out which website has the most accurate weather predictions. We'll write some code to scrape to scrape long-term weather predictions from a variety of sites every day and we'll store the predictions in a database. Later, we'll compare those records against officially logged weather data so that we can figure out which sites have the most accurate long-term predictions. This exercise is designed to give you practice in two things: 1) collaborative coding; and 2) using GitHub.

We'll split up into teams of two and each team will write code that extends an abstract WeatherScraper class in order to gather weather predictions from one particular website. The project has an official GitHub repository, so we'll learn how you can get the code, modify it, and commit your changes to the repository.

If we can get our project up and running by Reading Week, we'll let it run until the end of the term and then we'll compare the results. (If you're fishing about for a final project, you might want to implement data visualization for this!)

There is a preliminary list of weather sites on Moodle, but we should feel free to add more.
